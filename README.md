Custom bootc image for my needs.
It is very much this in it's experimental stage.
The image is not meant to be used as a gaming system.
NVIDIA support will never arrive as that is too much of a hassle to implement a deal with.

Special thanks to Zirconium: https://github.com/zirconium-dev/zirconium 
and
XeniaOS: https://github.com/XeniaMeraki/XeniaOS
as both served as an inspiration for this image.
