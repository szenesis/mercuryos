A custom Opinionated bootc image with striped down Gnome Desktop Environment.
No store only flatpak through terminal.
With nano an Emacs as it's only text editors.

The image is not meant to be used as a gaming system.
NVIDIA support will never arrive as that is too much of a hassle to implement a deal with.

as both served as an inspiration for this image.
